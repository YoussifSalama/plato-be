Strictly follow the schema.\n\nYour output JSON must have **three main keys**: \n1. \"structured\": detailed extracted fields.\n2. \"analysis\": insights about the candidate including a calculated score.\n3. \"ai_insights\": additional AI-driven observations.\n\n**Ensure:**\n- Strict JSON compliance (no trailing commas, no comments).\n- Nested objects and arrays where appropriate.\n- Handle missing or incomplete fields gracefully using `null` or empty arrays.\n- Use clear, concise, and unambiguous values.\n- Avoid hallucinations: do not invent certifications, skills, or experience.\n- If unsure about any data, set it to `null` or an empty array.\n- Maintain consistency between structured data and analysis.\n\n**Score Weighting Table (Total = 100 points):**\n{\n  \"coreSkills\": 40,\n  \"experience\": 25,\n  \"education\": 10,\n  \"softSkills_languages\": 10,\n  \"certifications_awards\": 5,\n  \"projects_extras\": 10\n}\n\n**Score Calculation Pseudocode:**\nscore = \n  coreSkillsScore * 0.40 +\n  experienceScore * 0.25 +\n  educationScore * 0.10 +\n  softSkillsScore * 0.10 +\n  certificationsScore * 0.05 +\n  projectsScore * 0.10\n\nAll individual component scores are normalized 0–100 before applying weight.\n\n**JSON Schema Example:**\n{\n  \"structured\": {\n    \"name\": string | null,\n    \"contact\": {\n      \"email\": string | null,\n      \"phone\": string | null,\n      \"linkedin\": string | null,\n      \"github\": string | null\n    },\n    \"education\": [\n      {\n        \"degree\": string | null,\n        \"institution\": string | null,\n        \"year\": number | null\n      }\n    ] | [],\n    \"experience\": [\n      {\n        \"title\": string | null,\n        \"company\": string | null,\n        \"start_year\": number | null,\n        \"end_year\": number | \"Present\" | null\n      }\n    ] | [],\n    \"skills\": [string] | [],\n    \"certifications\": [string] | [],\n    \"languages\": [string] | []\n  },\n  \"analysis\": {\n    \"score\": number,\n    \"seniorityLevel\": string,\n    \"recommendation\": string,\n    \"insights\": {\n      \"strengths\": [string] | [],\n      \"weaknesses\": [string] | []\n    }\n  },\n  \"ai_insights\": {\n    \"matched_job_titles\": [string] | [],   // Suggested job roles based on skills & experience\n    \"ai_thought\": string                     // Short AI narrative about candidate's potential and fit\n  }\n}\n\n**Instructions for AI:**\n- Parse the resume text carefully and extract all relevant structured data.\n- Compute the \"score\" using the weighting rules.\n- Identify seniority level based on experience, skills, and education.\n- Provide hiring recommendation: \"Recommended\", \"Consider\", \"Not Recommended\".\n- Identify key strengths and weaknesses.\n- Suggest possible job titles that fit the candidate (matched_job_titles).\n- Write a short AI narrative about the candidate (ai_thought) summarizing potential, fit, and risks.\n- Be aware of common AI pitfalls:\n    - Do not hallucinate details (skills, companies, degrees, certifications).\n    - Avoid vague statements; provide concrete insights where possible.\n    - Keep structured and analysis data consistent.\n- Always return a single valid JSON object matching the schema.\n"},{"role":"user","content":"Youssif salama\nFULL STACK DEVELOPER\nyoussifsalama01@gmail.com 01556543218 Cairo Youssif Salama Youssif Salama\nEgyptian Military: exempt\nProfile\nFull Stack TypeScript Developer with 3 years of experience, specializing in designing and delivering secure,\nscalable software solutions using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, React, and Next.js.
