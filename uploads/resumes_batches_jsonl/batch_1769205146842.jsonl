Strictly follow the schema.\n\nYour output JSON must have **three main keys**: \n1. \"structured\": detailed extracted fields.\n2. \"analysis\": insights about the candidate including a calculated score.\n3. \"ai_insights\": additional AI-driven observations.\n\n**Ensure:**\n- Strict JSON compliance (no trailing commas, no comments).\n- Nested objects and arrays where appropriate.\n- Handle missing or incomplete fields gracefully using `null` or empty arrays.\n- Use clear, concise, and unambiguous values.\n- Avoid hallucinations: do not invent certifications, skills, or experience.\n- If unsure about any data, set it to `null` or an empty array.\n- Maintain consistency between structured data and analysis.\n- Keep total analysis time under 5 seconds per resume.\n\n**Score Weighting Table (Total = 100 points):**\n{\n  \"role_fit_and_core_skills\": 30,        // Match to role requirements, core skills alignment\n  \"experience_impact\": 20,               // Depth, scope, achievements, progression\n  \"performance_productivity\": 15,        // Results, efficiency, quality, output indicators\n  \"retention_engagement_indicators\": 10, // Stability, tenure, engagement signals\n  \"leadership_collaboration\": 10,        // People leadership, cross-functional work\n  \"education_certifications\": 10,        // Formal education and recognized certs\n  \"projects_initiative\": 5               // Side projects, initiative, extra contributions\n}\n\n**Score Calculation Pseudocode:**\nscore = \n  roleFitScore * 0.30 +\n  experienceImpactScore * 0.20 +\n  performanceProductivityScore * 0.15 +\n  retentionEngagementScore * 0.10 +\n  leadershipCollaborationScore * 0.10 +\n  educationCertificationsScore * 0.10 +\n  projectsInitiativeScore * 0.05\n\nAll individual component scores are normalized 0–100 before applying weight.\n\n**Recommendation Enum (allowed values):**\n- \"recommended\"\n- \"not_recommended\"\n- \"consider\"\n- \"highly_recommended\"\n\n**Recommendation Mapping (based on final score):**\n- score < 50 => \"not_recommended\"\n- 50 <= score < 70 => \"consider\"\n- score >= 70 => \"highly_recommended\"\n\n**JSON Schema Example:**\n{\n  \"structured\": {\n    \"name\": string | null,\n    \"contact\": {\n      \"email\": string | null,\n      \"phone\": string | null,\n      \"linkedin\": string | null,\n      \"github\": string | null,\n      \"portfolio\": string | null\n    },\n    \"location\": {\n      \"city\": string | null,\n      \"country\": string | null\n    },\n    \"current_title\": string | null,\n    \"total_experience_years\": number | null,\n    \"education\": [\n      {\n        \"degree\": string | null,\n        \"institution\": string | null,\n        \"year\": number | null\n      }\n    ] | [],\n    \"experience\": [\n      {\n        \"title\": string | null,\n        \"company\": string | null,\n        \"start_year\": number | null,\n        \"end_year\": number | \"Present\" | null,\n        \"highlights\": [string] | []\n      }\n    ] | [],\n    \"skills\": [string] | [],\n    \"tools\": [string] | [],\n    \"certifications\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": string | null,\n        \"issuer\": string | null,\n        \"year\": number | null\n      }\n    ] | [],\n    \"languages\": [string] | [],\n    \"projects\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": string | null,\n        \"description\": string | null,\n        \"tech\": [string] | []\n      }\n    ] | []\n  },\n  \"analysis\": {\n    \"score\": number,\n    \"seniorityLevel\": string,\n    \"recommendation\": \"recommended\" | \"not_recommended\" | \"consider\" | \"highly_recommended\",\n    \"insights\": {\n      \"strengths\": [string] | [],\n      \"weaknesses\": [string] | []\n    }\n  },\n  \"ai_insights\": {\n    \"matched_job_titles\": [string] | [],\n    \"ai_thought\": string,\n    \"suggested_next_roles\": [string] | []\n  }\n}\n\n**Instructions for AI:**\n- Parse the resume text carefully and extract all relevant structured data.\n- Compute the \"score\" using the weighting rules.\n- Set \"recommendation\" strictly using the recommendation mapping.\n- Identify seniority level based on experience, skills, and education.\n- Provide hiring recommendation using only the enum values.\n- Identify key strengths and weaknesses.\n- Suggest possible job titles that fit the candidate (matched_job_titles).\n- Write a short AI narrative about the candidate (ai_thought) summarizing potential, fit, and risks.\n- Be aware of common AI pitfalls:\n    - Do not hallucinate details (skills, companies, degrees, certifications).\n    - Avoid vague statements; provide concrete insights where possible.\n    - Keep structured and analysis data consistent.\n- Always return a single valid JSON object matching the schema.\n"},{"role":"user","content":"Viola Shafik Isaac\n📧 violaashafeek@gmail.com | 📱 +20 127 581 4626 | LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/viola-shafik\nProfessional Summary\nCustomer-focused Law graduate with diverse experience in human resources, sales,\noperations, and administration.
